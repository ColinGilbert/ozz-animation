Release version 0.8.0.----------------------------------------------------------
 
 # Build pipeline
  - Adds and support -wextra option on gcc/clang.

 # Library

!!! sample/optimize/cmakelists -> change fbx2anim back to dae2anim

  - [animation] Improves quaternion compression scheme by quantizing the 3
  smallest components of the quaternion, instead of the firsts 3. This improves
  numerical accuracy when the restored component (4th) was small. It also allows
  to pre-multiply each of the 3 smallest components by sqrt(2), maximizing
  quantization range (from 32767 to 46339, which wins over 41%).

Release version 0.7.2.----------------------------------------------------------

 # Library
  - [animation] Improves rotations accuracy during animation sampling and
  blending. Quaternion normalization now uses one more Newton-Raphson step when
  computing inverse square root.
  - [offline] Fixes fbx animation duration when take duration is different to
  timeline length.
  - [offline] Bakes fbx axis/unit systems to all transformations, vertices,
  animations (and so on...), instead of using fbx sdk ConvertScene strategy
  which only transform scene root. This allows to mix skeleton, animation and
  meshes imported from any axis/unit system.
  - [offline][issue 6] Uses bind-pose transformation, instead of identity, for
  skeleton joints that are not animated in a fbx file.
  - [offline] Adds support to ozz fbx tools (fbx2skel and fbx2anim) for other
  formats: Autodesk AutoCAD DXF (.dxf), Collada DAE (.dae), 3D Studio 3DS (.3ds)
  and Alias OBJ (.obj). This toolchain based on fbx sdk will replace dae
  toolchain (dae2skel and dae2anim) which is now deprecated.
  - [offline] Adds a command line option to dae2anim and fbx2anim to enable or
  disable keyframes optimization. Optimizations are enabled by default.

 # HowTos
  - Adds file loading how-to, which demonstrates how to open a file and
  deserialize an object with ozz archive library.
  - Adds custom skeleton importer how-to, which demonstrates RawSkeleton setup
  and conversion to runtime skleton.
  - Adds custom animation importer how-to, which demonstrates RawAnimation setup
  and conversion to runtime animation.

 # Samples
  - [skin][issue 5] Skin sample now uses the inverse bind-pose matrices imported
  from the mesh file, instead of the one computed from the skeleton. This is a
  more robust solution, which furthermore allow to share the skeleton with
  meshes using different bind-poses.
  - [skin] Fixes joints weight normalization when importing fbx skin meshes.
  - [framework] Optimizes dynamic vertex buffer object re-allocation strategy.

Release version 0.7.1.----------------------------------------------------------

 # Library
  - [offline] Updates to fbx sdk 2015.1 with vs2013 support.
  
 # Samples
  - Adds sample_skin_fbx2skin to binary packages.

Release version 0.7.0.----------------------------------------------------------

 # Library
  - [geometry] Adds support for matrix palette skinning transformation in a new
  ozz_geometry library.
  - [offline] Returns EXIT_FAILURE from dae2skel and fbx2skel when no skeleton
  found in the source file.
  - [offline] Fixes fbx axis and unit system conversions.
  - [offline] Removes raw_skeleton_archive.h and raw_animation_archive.h files,
  moving serialization definitions back to raw_skeleton.h and raw_animation.h
  to simplify understanding.
  - [offline] Removes skeleton_archive.h and animation_archive.h files, moving
  serialization definitions back to skeleton.h and animation.h.
  - [base] Changes Range<>::Size() definition, returning range's size in bytes
  instead of element count.

 # Samples
  - Adds a skinning sample which demonstrates new ozz_geometry SkinningJob
  feature and usage.

Release version 0.6.0.----------------------------------------------------------

 # Library
  - [animation] Compresses animation key frames memory footprint. Rotation key
  frames are compressed from 24B to 12B (50%). 3 of the 4 components of the
  quaternion are quantized to 2B each, while the 4th is restored during
  sampling. Translation and scale components are compressed to half float,
  reducing their size from 20B to 12B (40%).
  - [animation] Changes runtime::Animation class serialization format to support
  compression. Serialization retro-compatibility for this class has not been
  implemented, meaning that all runtime::Animation must be rebuilt and
  serialized using usual dae2anim, fbx2anim or using offline::AnimationBuilder
  utility.
  - [base] Adds float-to-half and half-to-float conversion functions to simd
  math library.

Release version 0.5.0.----------------------------------------------------------

 # Library
  - [offline] Adds --raw option to *2skel and *2anim command line tools. Allows
  to export raw skeleton/animation object format instead of runtime objects.
  - [offline] Moves RawAnimation and RawSkeleton from the builder files to
  raw_animation.h and raw_skeleton.h files.
  - [offline] Renames skeleton_serialize.h and animation_serialize.h to
  skeleton_archive.h and animation_archive.h for consistency.
  - [offline] Adds RawAnimation and RawSkeleton serialization support with ozz
  archives.
  - [options] Changes parser command line arguments type from "const char**" to
  "const char* const*" in order to support implicit casting from arguments of
  type "char**".
  - [base] Change ozz::String std redirection from typedef to struct to be
  coherent with all other std containers redirection.
  - [base] Moves maths archiving file from ozz/base/io to ozz/base/maths for
  consistency.
  - [base] Adds containers serialization support with ozz archives.
  - [base] Removes ozz fixed size integers in favor of standard types available
  with <stdint.h> file.

 # Samples
  - Adds Emscripten support to all supported samples.
  - Changes OpenGL rendering to comply with Gles2/WebGL.

 # Build pipeline
  - Adds Emscripten and cross-compilation support to the builder helper python
  script.
  - Support for CMake 3.x.
  - Adds support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.
  - Drops support fot Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and olders, as a consequence
  of using <stdint.h>.

Release version 0.4.0.----------------------------------------------------------

 # Library
  - [offline] Adds Fbx import pipeline, through fbx2skel and fbx2anim command
  line tools.
  - [offline] Adds Fbx import and conversion library, through
  ozz_animation_offline_fbx. Building fbx related libraries requires fbx sdk to
  be installed.
  - [offline] Adds ozz_animation_offline_tools library to share the common work
  for Collada and Fbx import tools. This could be use to implement custom
  conversion command line tools.
